# Unmet Needs Report Analysis

### Overview

The State of Connecticut Office of Early Childhood published the 2020 Unmet Needs Report with the intention 
of documenting its processes and models for determining the standards by which needs for access to and quality of care
can be met.

### Data

The report has around many tables of data, several of which are town level analyses of capacity-related statistics.

The data was copied from the report and put into an Excel spreadhseet format.

The columns were later edited in order to facility data analysis and visualization in Jupyter Notebook

### Analysis and Visualization

Two datasets in particular were analyzed: 'Overall Supply and Estimated Demand for Child Care by Age and By Town'
and 'Town Level Program Characteristics' there were selected because they contained information on every town in 
the state of Connecticut that was related to early child care and education.

The bulk of the visualizations consists of bar charts showing the 30 towns with the greatest demonstrated need
in a paricular area. For example, shortage of care for infants/toddlers and preschoolers by town.

Other indicators were included because they had potential for indicating shortage of care or unmet need in some
capacity. These include, wheelchair accessibility, medication administration, and capacity for accredited care.

Every analysis had a component where top 30 towns were computed for infants/toddlers and preschoolers,
respectively.

Towns that showed up uin multiple lists were then suggested to be in danger of having unmet needs.
Whether this method can be used for determining unmet needs by town is still being considered.
